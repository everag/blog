# Author

Hi! I'm **Ev Agner (he/they)**, a brazilian Staff Software Engineer and writer based in NYC.

This is my personal blog and website, where I will primarily share my thoughts on software engineering, but may also occasionally talk about other topics such as gaming, my journey learning japanese and personal thoughts.

All opinions expressed here are my own and, particularly when it comes to technical content and opinions, do not reflect or represent the opinions of any current or previous employers.

# About AI

I will never use AI to write content for this blog. All posts come from my own thoughts and experiences, and are motivated by my desire to share ideas, thoughts and knowledge with others.

I may, however, use AI to revise content and, especially, fix grammatical errors or general typos. This is particular important to me because, while I do feel pretty comfortable with the english language, it's still not my native language.
