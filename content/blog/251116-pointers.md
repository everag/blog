When I started college, in the far away year of 2005 (wow, time flies), I had little to no experience in software development. To not say I knew absolutely nothing about it, during high school I took a training course with a friend on Microsoft Office tools and learned a little bit of basic boolean logic (if/elses), despite not really knowing what that meant, for writing Excel formulas or simple (granted, copy-pasted) macros in Visual Basic.

In my home town (Curitiba / Brazil), there was an emerging market for software development on the banking industry, largely motivated by HSBC, the multinational financial services company, which was investing heavily in the city and the region and had built their "IT headquarters" there.

Naturally, the Colleges and Universities in the city and the state wanted to align their curriculum with the market's demands. After all, they would be training and preparing the next generation of software developers.

## Banking tech

If you talk to anyone that has ever worked in the banking industry, at least over the last 20 years (likely more, but that's as far as my career goes), you'll likely hear the same quote: "We're split between legacy mainframe based technologies (like COBOL), and modern tech, and trying to both migrate some of our code and bridge the rest".
