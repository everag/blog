      <description>&lt;p&gt;When I started college, in the far away year of 2005 (wow, time flies), I had little to no experience in software development. To not say I knew absolutely nothing about it, during high school I took a training course with a friend on Microsoft Office tools and learned a little bit of basic boolean logic (if/elses), despite not really knowing what that meant, for writing Excel formulas or simple (granted, copy-pasted) macros in Visual Basic.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
